### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### Mega-CodeRefinery?

Welcome to the *first* online mega-CodeRefinery.  This is "mega"
because in the past we have always been limited by physical space or
number of helpers.  *We are now taking direct action to reach as many
people as possible, but this also means we are trying something new.*
We are introducing the concept of **teams** to "bring your own breakout
rooms" to accept as many people as possible.


### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can register as a helper.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with these tools, you can be a helper! (see below)
- Register as a team, one helper and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams.
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery before and have used git some after
that, you are definitely capable of being a helper.  If you routinely
use git and know Python somewhat well, you are also very qualified to
be a helper.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.


### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links at right.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics anyway, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
- Make sure that git is configured, and verify the configuration:
  [text instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/#configuring-git),
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&t=258s).

### FAQ

- **Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **Am I good enough to be a helper?**  If you are asking this
  question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
  git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
  be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

- **How does the waitlist work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general).

* **If the workshop is streamed/published, will I be visible?**
  Privacy and internal safety is our first concern.  Only instructors
  video will be published.  If you use voice to questions in the main room,
  that might be published.  The most common way to ask questions is
  written, and anyone can feel comfortable using this.  Breakout
  rooms, where all of the hands-on work and most discussion happens,
  is always private and unrecorded.

* **I can't register/didn't make it past the waiting list, and I would
  like to follow the streams myself.**  We don't yet know if we will
  do this or what the format will be.  Please check back for further
  information.  Note, we highly recommend registering as a team if
  possible, you will get much more out of the workshop if you are a
  part of it.

* **Is there any way I can follow along?**  We'll try to live stream
  it, see below.  The experience won't be the same, but we do what we
  can.

* **If it's online, why did you close?**  CodeRefinery workshops are
  interactive, with lots of interaction between instructors, helpers,
  and learners.  We can scale one-to-many easily, but we reached the
  limits of an interactive format.

* **When are registrations approved?**  We will look through number
  of attendees and number of helpers, and accept who we can and direct
  the rest to the live stream.

* **How can I be notified of updates?**  Currently, we don't have any
  way.  Follow [@coderefine](https://twitter.com/coderefine) on
  Twitter.

* **We still need helpers**, they may still register <a href="https://indico.neic.no/event/141/registrations/66/">here</a>.



## Streaming info

We will live stream the course so that others, who did not have
time to register, will be able to follow along.  However, this is
best-effort and we will stop streaming if it seem unworkable.

**Check back for more information,** (over the weekend) including
set-up instructions.  We will stream at
<https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery>.

Advice on following the stream:

* **Take this seriously.**  Don't do multiple meetings, reserve the entire
  timeslots on your calendar, attend every session, do the preparation.

* **Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
  it.**  In real workshops, problems here slow us down a lot, and if
  you don't prepare, you will immediately fall behind.  We might have
  a pre-workshop stream to go over installation.

* **Form a team anyway.**  You learn more from your colleagues than
  you do from us, so take advantage.  Get one "helper" for your team, start
  your own video call, watch the stream together, and during the
  exercise times, work together.  We will be clear about our
  timing, so that you can coordinate your team.  (Of course, you can
  always follow individually)

* You can interact on the **livestream chat**, but we don't promise to
  be able to watch it.

* **Announcements and updates** go to [this Github
  issue](https://github.com/coderefinery/2020-05-25-online/issues/25).
  You can subscribe to it for notifications, but there is no other way
  to sign up for info - also keep checking this webpage
  for details.  Follow
  [@coderefine](https://twitter.com/coderefine) on Twitter for news,
  too.

* We don't know what lessons we will stream yet.  We hope to all, but
  will see about practicalities.

* We stream on Twitch, and there should be someone interacting with
  the Twitch chat to provide some support.

* **Come to an in-person workshop sometime.**  The stream probably
  can't replace the experience and individual help you get in person.
