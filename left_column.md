* **News item 1**


Because of our Nordic funding, priority is for Nordic participants.
Everyone gets added to a waitlist initially, and we
approve people as we get space.  Check
back for updates.


### Live streaming

Yes, we are.  Streams available at <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>, See [right bottom â†’](#streaming-info)


### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive online event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.

We might live stream or record (part of ) the workshop to reach an
even wider audience.  In this case, privacy is our first concern and
*only* the instructor's video will be published, and *breakout rooms
for exercises are completely private*.  More details will come later.


### Software requirements

You need to install some software *before* CodeRefinery ([why we ask
you to do
this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page.  **You also need to check your git configuration**
([video: how to configure Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDTp8NeHBs&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)).
**If you have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.**

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some **configuration**
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)
- [Zoom](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/zoom/) (note: a
  new version released on 27.april will be required for the second
  week!)
- University computer specific instructions:
  - [Aalto University](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/news/coderefinery/)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**
