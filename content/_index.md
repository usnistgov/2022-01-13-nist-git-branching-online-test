## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online.

* You can attend by registering and
  receiving the Zoom link, which lets you take part in teams and
  breakout rooms. (limited places)

* Anyone may also attend via the livestream at
  [twitch.tv/coderefinery](https://twitch.tv/coderefinery).  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.
