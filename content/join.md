## How to join

We are normally limited by number of expert helpers and individual exercise leaders, thus we have two options:

### Zoom registration

In Zoom, we group attendees into teams, with an exercise leader.  This
is a very interactive workshop.

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Complete teams are preferred: one exercise leader and 4-6 learners:
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide on a team name, and provide it when registering,
    so that we can link teammates together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the exercise leader has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors/expert helpers drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if as an exercise leader you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together. If you will work together later,
    learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.
- If you routinely use Git and know Python somewhat well or you've been to
  a CodeRefinery before, you are definitely capable of being an exercise leader and register as one!

### Accessibility

We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.

* Breakout rooms with exercise leaders gives a community atmosphere
  and private help.
* Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
  by demo.
* We post the notes so you can review at your own
  pace later on.  
* Lesson websites use standard web technologies, so that
  browser accessibility plugins can be used.
* We have figures in some lessons which are somewhat important,
  without good alt text.  We are working on this, contributions
  welcome.
